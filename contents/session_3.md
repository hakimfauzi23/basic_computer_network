## What is a Networking Model? And Why it has to be modeled? ##

### Network Model ###
Computer network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources and trade informations. terms in network each devices that connected each other is referred as **nodes**, this computer network can be connected with some medium like cables, signal, or fiber optics. 

When share each other information through computer network, the process is complex and tend to be cannot be define in one flow, so the network modeling is needed because it's separate complex process into some layer so it can be more defined and easy to understand by human, also the process is always be compatible  with other devices that connect into computer network, there are 2 commons Network Model nowdays there are **TCP/IP** and **OSI**.

Frameworks or Networking Models like **OSI** and **TCP/IP** makes Computer Networking has **Standardization** to make sure all devices have same rules for communication, and then because the process is separate each **Layer** making the networks moduler easier to develop and troubleshoot, also the network has high **Scalability** or can be expand seamlessly.   

### OSI (Open System Interconnection) ###
This network model separate complex process into 7 layers. 
1. **Physical Layer**   
2. **Data Link Layer** 
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**
7. **Application Layer**

### TCP/IP  ###
1. **Link Layer**
2. **Internet Layer**
3. **Transport Layer**
4. **Application Layer**
